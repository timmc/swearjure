# Swearjure compiler

Swearjure is Clojure without alphanumerics, an abomination perpetrated
by [Gary Fredericks (gfrlog)](http://gfredericks.com/),
[Jean Niklas L'orange (hypirion)](http://hypirion.com), and
myself. (hypirion has a
[great intro/exploration](http://hypirion.com/musings/swearjure)
piece.)

For no good reason, this repo is a work in progress on a compiler from
a restricted subset of Clojure into Swearjure. (See
`src/org/timmc/swearjure.clj` for notes on remaining work.)

This is not supposed to be particularly useful.
